# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#.idea/
/data/cifar-10-batches-py/*
/data/cifar-10-python.tar.gz

# Ignore all contents of the data directory...
data/*
datasets/*
# ...but re-include the class_names file.
